        <strong>Accessibility policy</strong>
        <p>The management committee of The Trade Fair does not permit any pets to enter the area of the property right of admission reserved. </p>

        <strong>Early arrival and late departures</strong>
        <p>Just in case, if any of our customers holding the room booking from the next morning arrive early and want to access their room books, we recommend that you book your room a night prior so that you get immediate access to your room. And likewise, for late departures, you can access your room for an additional day and night on the condition that you do not leave the hotel premises. Whereas, if you do not wish to reserve a room, then we recommend you to store your bag and luggage and use our fitness facilities for freshening.</p>

        <p>The guaranteed reservations of Hotel The Trade Fair assure you check in even late in the evening after 6 pm. But we require a one night deposit for booking your guaranteed reservation. The reservations made from the website have to be guaranteed with a credit card. </p>

        <strong>Cancellation of bookings</strong>
        <p>The cancellation of any booked room must be received by us at least 48 hours before the date of your arrival. If the cancellation had not been made 48 hours before, we shall charge for one-night accommodation.</p>
